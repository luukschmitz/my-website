# Luuk Schmitz

I am a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies in Cologne.

I research structural transformations in European political economy, focusing on the political economy of public policy, the role of narratives in (re)politicizing economic policy, and the relation between the two.

You can find more information about my research, publications, and contact info on this website. I occasionally post miscellaneous entries in my blog on more general academic interests.
