My research lies at the intersection between international and comparative political economy, economic sociology, and EU studies. At the most basic level, I am interested in explaining the way people - individually and collectively - deal with the contradictions and paradoxes continuously evoked by the interaction between states and markets. Concretely, I am interested in international political economy, industrial policy, EU external policy, and business power. The project descriptions below will give some hint as to why these areas are particularly replete with fascinating contradictions, unlocking political contention and changes that allow us to better understand the social world.
