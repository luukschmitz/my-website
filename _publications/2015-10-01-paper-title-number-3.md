**Central and Eastern European countries at the crossroads: Why governments should reject investment arbitration in TTIP**

Perhaps the most contentuous issue in the ill-fated Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) was the envisioned inclusion of an investment arbitration system that would allow private investors to sue governments when policy change and regulatory measures would compromise expected future profits. The bounds of legitimate capacity to regulate are ill-defined and therefore threaten governments' capacity to act in the public interest. Such a system is, moreover, redundant when investors have sound recourse to domestic courts.

I conducted research on and co-authored this policy brief during my internship at the Transnational Institute in Amsterdam. Read [here](https://www.tni.org/files/download/governments_should_reject_isds_in_ttip.pdf)
